# My Wife Pregnancy

These days my wife Monika is in her pregnancy period, Therefor I should put stress on her health.

Nutrition is a major aspect of taking care of her. I'm trying to give her appetite. Pregnant women can't stand the smell of all kinds of meets, perfumes and so on. Because it can make them nauseated and it possible for them to throw up vomit. So, as a result, I should use some vegetables that are full of protein instead of meets, Stew as a main dish and salad as an appetizer. Furthermore, pregnant women have cravings for sweets and sours, so I got out and bought some chocolates and mouthwatering greengage for my lovely wife.

One thing you should know about my wife is that she is not an easily-led person and I had to make an attempt to make her exercise from time to time, and if want to be honest it is one of her qualities that made me fall in love with her.

Another important matter regarding pregnancy is good and adequate rest. lack of sleep has an adverse effect on her health and it will lead her to physical weakness. She made a swear to take better care for herself.

I know that she is trying to help me save on costs,  but she knows that if something bad happens to them it will cost me my life Since I made an oath of loyalty to her.

Time flies. It has been 20 years since that time and now I am a married man with two beautiful girls, Susan and Hannah. As time goes by, there will be memories; some are rubbing salt on the wound and some are relief on the wounded pride.

Monika has aged well and improved with age. Unfortunately, nowadays life is astronomically expensive and sometimes our daughters get fed up with some life issues. But despite all this, we know that they can become independent and stand on their own feet when the time comes.
