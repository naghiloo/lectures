I know that it is  tempting to live in a big cities but unfortunately the air pollution is high and there is heavy traffic on the most of streets but you can use fast public transportation. If you are satisfied with living in a big city, Let me tell you that it is going to cost a lot. Big cities are expensive, but you don’t worry because easier to find a job in them, which you can enjoy.

One of the disadvantages of living in a big city is that the crime rate is high and people are worried about their safety but city officials try to make streets more safe.

On the other hand, small towns are peaceful, quiet and safe. Air is cleaner and there isn’t heavy traffic on the roads compared to big cities. Lack of facilities and poor services are major disadvantages in them. There are a few or no theaters, cinemas and other kind of entertainments. There are schools and universities but the bad news is that there isn’t a vast variety of majors and sometimes you have to choose what there is.
