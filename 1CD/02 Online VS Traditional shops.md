# Online VS Traditional shops

Some hobbies are vital to happiness in our life while gratifying our basic needs, Shopping is one of them. Everybody is involved in this activity unwillingly. Nowadays there are two general ways that you can submit your order, Online and traditional. Despite the numerous pros and cons in both of them, experiencing a fine purchase depends on individualâ€™s taste and situation.

Based on my experiences, the comparison is a major advantage of online shopping. I mean you can check, select and buy your required product among a variety of goods faster. Online shops are more comfortable than traditional ones for people who are leading a busy life Because there is a 24/7 access to them all around the world.

However online shopping is not convenient for people who need their order quickly or even need to feel or see them before order registration since it takes time to return faulty goods. On the other hand, traditional shops give price-conscious people a chance to bargain for a better price. Although they should search store to store for their needs, they will have a direct interaction with the products.
