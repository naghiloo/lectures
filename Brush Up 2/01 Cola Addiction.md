# Cola Addiction

Addiction is a psychological and physical inability to stop consuming or doing certain things, for example, chemical substance, drugs or activities such as foot tapping or finger cracking and nail-biting, even though it is causing psychological and physical harm. Some addictions also involve an inability to stop partaking in activities, such as gambling, eating, or working. In these circumstances, a person has a behavioral addiction. When people experience addiction, they cannot control how they use a substance or partake in an activity, and they become dependent on this lack of control, in order to cope with their daily life.

In 1964 a World Health Organization (WHO) Committee introduced the term ‘dependence’ to replace the terms ‘addiction’ and ‘habituation’. In other words, Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system. An addiction always creates harmful, often ignored consequences. Only when the addiction becomes unmanageable will people do something about it. Sugary drinks are considered a major contributor to health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tooth decay. But have you ever wondered exactly what these beverages do to your body after consumption? All the thing they talk about is scratching off the surface. There are approximately 10 teaspoons of added sugar in a single can of cola. the WHO recommends consuming no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar daily, this meanings drinking just one serving of cola a day could take us well above these guidelines.

Now I'm going to explain what happens to the body, an hour after drinking a can of Cola:

- - - -
Blood sugar levels increase dramatically within 20 minutes of drinking the Cola, causing a burst of insulin. The liver then turns the high amounts of sugar circulating our body into fat.
- - - -
Within 40 minutes, the body has absorbed all of the caffeine from the Cola, causing dilation of pupils and an increase in blood pressure. By this point, the adenosine receptors in the brain have been blocked, preventing fatigue.
- - - -
Five minutes later, production of dopamine has increased - a neurotransmitter that helps control the pleasure and reward centers of the brain. The way Cola stimulates these centers is comparable to the effects of heroin, making us want another can.
- - - -
An hour after drinking the beverage, a sugar crash will begin, causing irritability and drowsiness. In addition, the water from the Cola will have been cleared from the body via urination, along with nutrients that are important for our health.
It's not only applicable to Cola, but to all caffeinated fizzy drinks.

Cola is comparable to heroin, in its stimulation of the brain's reward and pleasure centers. The intense sweetness of Cola as a result of its high sugar content should make us throw up as soon as it enters the body. However, the phosphoric acid in the beverage dulls the sweetness, enabling us to keep the drink down.

As such, it is no surprise that sugary drink consumption is associated with an array of health conditions. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, people who drink 1-2 cans of sugary drinks daily are 26% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

4,000 deaths per year are down due to sugary drink consumption, globally. The Total amount of consumption of sugary drinks in the world is about 10 liters, the average consumption of soda in Iran is 4 times more than the world's average.

The choice is yours.
