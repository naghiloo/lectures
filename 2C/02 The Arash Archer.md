# The Arash archer

Abraham Lincoln, Mosaddegh, Chamran and so on. There are the names that the history will never forget, but why?
each of them, in their respective field, had a major breakthrough and did great things. Today I'm going to talk about legend, whose symbols are the honor, duty, and dignity.

Back in the ancient Persia, when it was the time of heroes. there was a great not ending battle between Persia and Turanian. After a long period of fighting, the Persia proposed a truth. But the Afrasiab, King of The Turanian declared a counterproposal, "fly of the arrow will determine boundaries". It was humiliation and offensive.

chaos began in Persia army and people. All the hope was lost, it was indeed dark time. But all of the sudden a hero emerges and accepted the Turanian's challenge knowing that there will be a price to pay.

by now I'm sure that you all know who am I talking about. What did he do for his country and his people? even if it is just a story, was truly an act of heroism and patriotism.

The obvious message of the story is that sometimes people deserve more, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. I personally believe that there must exist some people "like our hero in the story" that reward faith.

I want to end my speech with a quote from john f.kenedy: "Ask not what your country do for you, but ask what you can do for your country".
